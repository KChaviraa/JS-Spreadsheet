# JS-Spreadsheet

This project is a web-based spreadsheet application inspired by popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. It allows users to enter formulas and data into cells, perform calculations, and manipulate data similar to a traditional spreadsheet program.

Features:
Formula Evaluation: Users can enter formulas into cells using standard mathematical operators and functions.
Cell Referencing: Cells can reference other cells in formulas, enabling complex calculations and data manipulation.
Built-in Functions: The application includes built-in functions such as sum, average, median, and more, allowing users to perform common spreadsheet operations.
Dynamic Updates: When users change the value of a cell, formulas that depend on that cell automatically update to reflect the new value.
Range Operations: Users can perform operations on ranges of cells, such as summing a range of numbers or finding the average of a range.
UI Customization: The user interface is customizable, allowing users to arrange cells, adjust formatting, and personalize their workspace.

Usage:
Installation: Clone the repository to your local machine.

Setup: Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Usage: Enter data and formulas into cells, and observe the results. Formulas must start with an equal sign (=) to be recognized.

Customization: Modify the code to add new functions, customize the UI, or extend the application's functionality as needed.
